This document will be unilized in my portfolio as a walkthrough
of my problem solving skills.

The first problem I ran into was aligning the picture where I wanted it. I thought that using a flex model would solve this issue.
This works; but the way I went about it created a second issue; this caused me to break things until I found the issueL you cannot display:flex in the * group. This causes the webpage to display the title and javascript on the webpage in plain view and can cause several errors.
